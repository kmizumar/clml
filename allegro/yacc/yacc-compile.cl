;; construct-grammar-tables-1 derives a parser machine description from a grammar
;; specification.  This is somewhat arbitrarily divided into five phases:

;; (1) Perform consistency checks on the grammar specification, compute several useful
;; lists, and do minor transformations on the spec.

;; (2) Compute the set of parser states. (More below).

;; (3) Derive the two tables which describe the parser machine.

;; (4) Derive the default table, and fill in remaining actions with error.  Check that all
;;     states can be reached and all rules reduced.

;; (5) Compile the action functions. (Now happens only at compile time.)
;;

;; Phase 2 is the most opaque.  It's task is to construct a list of parser states which is
;; represented by this hairy data structure:
;;

;;   |                                   |                     |
;;  item                                item                  item
;;   o---#*lookahead-set                 o---#*lookahead-set   o---- ...
;;   |                                   |                     |

;;
;; Each sym is actually a terninal or nonterminal structure after pass1 starts.
;;
;; A lookahead set is a simple bit-vector the same length as the highest terminal pcode.
;; All nodes in this picture are cons cells except the productions and syms, which are
;; defstructs.  The names on the internal nodes of the structure identified with `o'
;; (state, item, core) are those usually employed as variable names in the code and derive
;; from the Aho & Johnson article.
;;
;; For speed reasons (e.g., using eq instead of equal) the cores share structure; a
;; particular position in a particular production rhs will always be shared between the
;; several states that contain it.  The list of symbols which is a core is terminated by a
;; last cdr which is the production containing the rhs (and thus the core).  Lookahead
;; sets must be merged during state generation, so they never share cons cells.
